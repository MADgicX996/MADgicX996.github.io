The research is presenting a working software prototype'IMMERSIVE', an interactive design platform providing the architect/designer with a new perspectives for the design object, which enrich how the designers perceiving the design problem while walking through the designed space in a fully immersive environment. It also provides a collaborative three-dimensional environment for design and review between architects and different experts from other disciplines, this collaborative virtual environment enhance the communication and encourages co-operation, overcoming the barriers of space and time constraints. Through the use of virtual reality designers can explore a different layers of building information, which makes the design process more intuitive. A shared world of virtual reality offers a more sophisticated, interactive stimulating and engaging environment for architects and professionals alike- to communicate. Therefore it’s a prototype that facilitates this kind of collaboration.",

        "desc": "The concept for the construction sites XIII and XV attaches particular importance to the integration of the structures into the future quarter at the Hörnbecken. In the concept for the TAS, new residential and flexible creative industries are being created for the 21st century. The parcelling of the large block edges into smaller units introduces an identity-creating element that simultaneously offers clear assignments of entrance situations, movement spaces, colonnade aisles and meeting points. A new interpretation of classic materials is also being considered for the façade. Here new brick structures and new interpretations of classical configurations are woven into an architectural context of small building structures.",
